Frying French Fries Heat oil in a wok or pan. Keep the flame to medium-low or medium. This flame range will depend on the heaviness of the pan. For a heavy pan, keep medium flame and for a less heavy pan, use a medium-low flame. The oil should have a medium-low heat or having a temperature of 130 to 135 degrees celsius.
